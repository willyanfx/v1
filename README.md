# V1

The first iteration of my personal site built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI**

    ```sh
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Install and switch to the correct version of Node using NVM**

    ```sh
    nvm install
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server**

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

## Building and Running for Production

In addition to the development server started with `yarn start`, you can also generate a full static production build and serve that to preview the site as it will appear once deployed:

```sh
yarn build
```

```sh
yarn serve
```
